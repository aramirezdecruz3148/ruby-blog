# About this project

* Used Rails Guides getting started tutorial as jumping off point: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html
I created this project to build my first Rails app. The full tutorial can be found here: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

I used the Rails Guides, getting started tutorial to build a simple blog application. I customized a few things including the CSS, just to get a feel for the environment.
